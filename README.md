\# ⚡ Energy Consumption Prediction



\## 📌 Overview

Machine learning–based project for predicting energy consumption using a public UCI dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance comparison across multiple approaches.



\## 📊 Dataset

\- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (public dataset)

\- Historical energy usage data with numerical/time-based features

\- Preprocessing includes missing value handling, feature scaling, and train–test split



\## ⚙️ Tech Stack

\- Python

\- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn

\- Developed using Google Colab



\## 📈 Results

\*\*Best Model:\*\* SVR  

Achieved the lowest RMSE and highest R² among all tested models.



Traditional ML models outperformed deep learning models on this dataset.



\## ▶️ How to Run

1\. Upload `energy\_prediction\_full.ipynb` to Google Colab  

2\. Run all cells
